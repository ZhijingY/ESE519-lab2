# ESE519-lab2

The machine I'm using is MacBook Pro, 13-inch, 2018, macOS version is Big Sur 11.7. Processor is 2.3GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5. 
To complete the setup, I have cloned the pico-examples and pico-sdk from github. I have downloaded Visual Studio Code.

I used Homebrew to install all the other softwares. If you don't have Homebrew yet, here are two links of guidance you can follow: 

https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/homebrew

https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/3.html.

After downloading Homebrew, we can follow the Section 9.1.1 in [Pico C SDK Getting Started Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) to download CMake and arm-none-eabi-gcc GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain.
